#Development

Today I did some research on the logistics of the game and looked how I can use the libraries available to help me with the project amd got started with some of the code.

Today I started to do the actual code and will start on the basic flight mechanics of the bird with the jumping and realistic gravity and such. Gravity is based on a singular variable speed and will have a constant value being added to it, which gives it a feel of there being gravity.

Implemented Gravity and tweaked values to have optimal jumping. Now begun to add basic piping structures.
