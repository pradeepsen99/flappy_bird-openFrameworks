# Project Proposal
For this project I plan to recreate the game FlappyBird using openFrameworks and some external libaries

## What this entails:
This project will be as close to the original game of FlappyBird as possible. So essentially there will be a bird thats 'flapping' through and the goal of the bird is to dodge the various obstacles that are coming at it. Those obstacles will be pipes that are at random lengths and the bird has to ensure that it doesn't hit any of the pipes. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible and attain the highest score possible.

## Libaries I plan on using
The libaries I plan on using for this project will be the ofxGUI addon for openFrameworks as that contains most of the things I need to do in terms of graphics and the movement of the flappy bird character and the random pipes that will spawn in the game while it is running.

##Background
My background is that I have made a flappy bird game before in the language VisualBasic and I was able to sucessfully recreate it. So from that experience I know how the mechanics of the game work and should help me with desiging the game to ensure that mechanically it is accurate and that I wouldn't be held up by any of the mechanics of the game.
