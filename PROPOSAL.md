# Project Proposal
The project I plan to be doing is a visualization of the mtd_bus system.

## What that entails.
I plan on using the bus data from the mtd databases on current bus information and use that to visualize the bus routes into google maps so a person can visualize routes when they are taking a trip to anywhere on the campus or anywhere using the mtd bus system.

## Libraries Ill be using
In order to visualize my data I need the help of a couple libraries. Listed below are the libraries I plan on using.

### JSON++
This library will help me parse through the JSON data given by the mtd api and will help in giving the information for google maps to map out. Link of the github: https://github.com/hjiang/jsonxx

## Background
I have background in JSON parson, from this class obviously and also from other projects I have been doing in other facets. This should help me in getting the raw data I need. I also have a background in using the mtd api with other projects I have worked with aswell so the data aspect of things should be of no problem to me.
